      <p class="book-description">
        Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam, the son of a little-educated
        boat-owner in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, had an unparalleled career as a
        defence scientist, culminating in the highest civilian award of India,
        the Bharat Ratna. As chief of the country's defence research and
        development programme, Kalam demonstrated the great potential for
        dynamism and innovation that existed in seemingly moribund research
        establishments. This is the story of Kalam's rise from obscurity and his
        personal and professional struggles, as well as the story of Agni,
        Prithvi, Akash, Trishul and Nag-missiles that have become household
        names in India and that have raised the nation to the level of a missile
        power of international reckoning. This is also the saga of independent
        India's struggle for technological self-sufficiency and defensive
        autonomy-a story as much about politics, domestic and international, as
        it is about science.
