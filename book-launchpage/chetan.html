      <h1>The 3 Mistakes of My Life</h1>
      <p class="author-name">by Chetan Bhagat</p>
      <p class="book-description">
        In late-2000, a young boy in Ahmedabad called Govind dreamt of having a
        business. To accomodate his friends Ish and Omi's passion, they open a
        cricket shop. Govind's wants to make money and thinks big. Ish is all
        about nurturing Ali, the batsman with a rare gift. Omi knows his limited
        capabiltiies and just wants to be with his friends. However, nothing
        comes easy in a turbulent city. To realize their goals, they will have
        to face it all - religious politics, earthquakes, riots, unacceptable
        love and above all, their own mistakes. Will they make it? Can an
        individual's dreams overcome the nightmares offered by real life? Can we
        succeed despite a few mistakes?
