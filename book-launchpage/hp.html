      <h1>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone</h1>
      <p class="author-name">by J.K Rowling</p>
      <p class="book-description">
        Harry Potter has never even heard of Hogwarts when the letters start
        dropping on the doormat at number four, Privet Drive. Addressed in green
        ink on yellowish parchment with a purple seal, they are swiftly
        confiscated by his grisly aunt and uncle. Then, on Harry's eleventh
        birthday, a great beetle-eyed giant of a man called Rubeus Hagrid bursts
        in with some astonishing news: Harry Potter is a wizard, and he has a
        place at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. An incredible
        adventure is about to begin!
